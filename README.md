# Dataloader Demo

Some code snippets for demonstrating how to use [java-dataloader](https://github.com/graphql-java/java-dataloader) 
to batch tasks. This also shows how to chain tasks that depend on each other and batch tasks
that have the same depth in the dependency graph. 
 
To run the demo in a loop: `./demo_loop.bash`
